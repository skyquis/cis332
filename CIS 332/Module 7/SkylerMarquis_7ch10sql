--Unit 6, Chapter 9 Assignment B
--==================================

--Chapter 10 - Create an SQL script with the solutions to all 10 of the Hands-On 
--problems at the end of Chapter 10.  Be sure to use single-row functions for 
--the solutions for Chapter 10.  Also, be sure to assign alias names to display 
--in the output so that the single-row function doesn't appear as the heading.  
--The alias names in the displayed results is required and worth points on this 
--assignment.

--Note: the JLDB_Build_8.sql  and JLDB_Build_10.sql  scripts (attached above) 
--are used before executing the statements in this chapter.

--Preparation for running the script
